# To-Do List Application üìù

This is a simple To-Do List project built with Vue.js. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. Additionally, tasks are saved in local storage (`localStorage`), so the list persists even after the user reloads the page or closes the browser.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Remove tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain available after reloading the page.
- **Simple and clean interface**: FontAwesome is used for button icons and smooth transitions for a pleasant user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
- **FontAwesome**: Icon library for the complete and delete buttons.
- **localStorage**: To store and retrieve tasks persistently across page reloads.
